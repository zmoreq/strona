        <h3>Text 2: Combat the Orange Peel Skin</h3>
        <p>
            How to reduce cellulite? – It’s a problem occupying the minds of women of practically all ages and scientists seeking an effective method of its reduction and prevention.<br><br>
            
            What is cellulite? – To a woman it is an unhealthy, unsightly orange peel look of the surface of her thighs, buttocks and arms, a sign of aging. To a scientist it is the effect of a slowed down process of fats removal (lipolysis) leading to their accumulation in the skin.<br><br>
            
            What to do? – There are many ways to follow, preferably in combination. Firstly, to apply a comprehensive anticellulite cosmetic treatment, including a set of different cosmetics designed to remove dead cells from the epidermis, to improve circulation and accelerate the removal of the superfluous products of metabolism from the skin, giving the skin a healthy look and making it smooth to touch. Secondly, to adapt a healthy lifestyle, that is, a healthy diet rich in fruit and vegetables and regular exercise. And, thirdly, to make use of the anticellulite treatments offered by beauty salons. These include not only massages but also other, often high-tech using procedures such as lipocuction, mesotherapy, mechanical roller massage therapy.<br><br>
            
            The term “cellulite” came to be used in cosmetology in 1973. However, the condition described as the orange skin syndrome, cottage cheese skin or mattress has long been known. We can even see it in some of the baroque pictures of Rubens’ beauties. The orange peel syndrome was first described by European physicians at the beginning of the 19th century, deficient circulation and fatty deposits being indicated as causes of the dimpled, orange peel-like texture of the skin. Cellulite is now reported to affect the thighs and buttocks of about 80 per cent of women worldwide.<br><br>
            
            <strong>There are three stages of cellulite:</strong><br>
            1st degree: orange peel appearance of the skin becomes visible when we pinch the skin of the thighs or buttocks;<br>
            2nd degree: orange peel appearance of the skin is visible to the naked eye, without pinching;<br>
            3rd degree: orange peel appearance of the skin is accompanied by nodules and puffed areas.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Anti-cellulite creams, gels, scrubs</strong><br>
            Cellulite combating cosmetics are usually a combination of ingredients such as caffeine, geranium, sandal tree, ginkgo, alpha hydroxy acids, theophylline, keratolin, zinc, manganese, copper and seaweeds such as kelp and fucus, centella asiatica, grape seed extract. They reduce the cellulite appearance by improving skin elasticity, strengthening and softening the skin. They also increase microcirculation and promote oxygen supply, emulsify fat, firm up the skin and encourage enzyme activity in breaking down fatty deposits under the skin surface.<br>
            They should be applied generously over the affected areas, being rubbed into the skin after a bath when the skin is still warm and the lymphatic flow increased. It is necessary to use them at least once or twice a day for a period of three months to obtain visible effects.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Anti-cellulite treatments</strong><br>
            Numerous anti-cellulite treatments have been developed to cater for the needs of women. They include body wraps, liposuction, fat injections, mesotherapy, mechanical roller massage therapy, endermologie.<br><br>
            
            Body wraps involve wrapping the body in linen sheets soaked with a variety of substances, including herbal extracts, seaweed and mud. The combined action of perspiration and compression has a body shaping effect and leads to a reduction of body dimensions due to loss of fluids. They produce temporary improvement in appearance but do not reduce or eliminate cellulite.<br><br>
            
            Liposuction is a cosmetic surgical procedure during which fat layers are removed producing firmer and thinner legs, buttocks, stomach and even arms. Fatty deposits are sucked up with the help of a hollow steel rod called cannula which is attached to a powerful vacuum. Postoperative bleeding and fluid accumulation are reduced by firm bandaging.<br><br>
            
            Fat injections consist in the injection of fat to smooth out cellulite dimples and bumps. Fat is obtained from other parts of the body and injected to the cellulite affected area. First developed for treating wrinkles, fat injection is now used to treat cellulite. However, the dimpling often reappears after a few months.<br><br>
            
            Mesotherapy involves multiple injections of homeopathic preparations to the cellulite area with the purpose of breaking down cellulite deposits and stimulating circulation. Multiple injections over a period of several weeks or months are needed to produce effects.<br><br>
            
            Mechanical roller massage therapy uses a mechanical roller and regulated suction to generate symmetrical skin folds. This non-invasive procedure, lasting from 30 to 45 minutes is a deep massage temporarily stimulating circulation in the area.<br><br>
            
            Endermologie is a procedure which involves massage with a highpowered, handheld massage tool, consisting of a treatment head and two motorised rollers with a suction device that compresses the tissue between the two rollers. Best results are obtained after 10 to 20 treatments followed by one or two maintenance treatments a month.
